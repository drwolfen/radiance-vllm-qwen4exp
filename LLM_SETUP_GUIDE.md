# R9V setup guide for AI assistants

This file is for LLM agents helping a user install and run R9V. It tells you
what to check, what order to do things in, and what you must not work around.
Human-readable background is in [README.md](README.md); the authoritative
step-by-step is [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## What you are setting up

R9V is a catalog of pinned, model-specific inference profiles for AMD RDNA4.
One profile is currently runnable end to end:

- `qwen38-flash-next/ud-iq4-xs/dual-r9700-128k` (alias `qwen38`) — an
  OpenAI-compatible server for Qwen3.8 Flash Next on two Radeon AI PRO R9700
  GPUs. This guide covers that profile.
- `muse-glimmer-30b/v1/single-r9700` (alias `muse`) — `fetch` works, but
  `build` and `run` fail closed on purpose. Do not try to bypass that; tell
  the user the runtime is not released yet.

The `./r9v` CLI at the repo root drives everything. It is stdlib-only
Python 3.10+; there is nothing to `pip install`.

## Rules

1. **Check hardware before downloading.** The model package is 90.36 GiB. Run
   `./r9v doctor qwen38` first and stop if the host does not qualify.
2. **Do not update the submodules.** The pinned commits are release inputs.
   `git submodule update --remote` or checking out branch heads forfeits the
   qualified behavior.
3. **Do not skip hash verification.** If `verify --hash` fails, the bundle is
   wrong; re-fetch rather than proceeding.
4. **Ask the user before accepting the model license.** `fetch` requires
   `--accept-model-license` (Qwen Community License 1.0). That acceptance is
   the user's decision, not yours.
5. **Fail-closed errors are intentional.** If a profile refuses to run because
   of GPU architecture, device count, VRAM, or status checks, report it. Do
   not patch checks out.
6. **Device order is semantic.** TP rank 1 holds the larger dynamic cache. Do
   not shuffle `R9V_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to make an error go away without
   checking `amd-smi list` first.

## Host requirements

Verify all of these before step 1:

| Requirement | How to check |
|---|---|
| Two 32 GiB Radeon AI PRO R9700 (`gfx1201`) | `amd-smi list` |
| ROCm driver, `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` access | `ls /dev/kfd /dev/dri` |
| Host RAM (128 GiB on the reference host) | `free -g` — see note below |
| Docker daemon + Buildx plugin | `docker info`, `docker buildx version` |
| Python ≥ 3.10, Git, `curl` | `python3 --version` |
| Hugging Face CLI | `hf version` (needed by `fetch`) |
| ~150 GiB free disk | 90.36 GiB model + 26.82 GiB PLE + build/caches |
| User in `render` and `video` groups | `id` |

`./r9v doctor qwen38` automates most of this. Trust its output over your own
guesses.

Host RAM note: 128 GiB is the qualified reference machine, not an enforced
minimum. Expert weights are UVA/page-cache resident and the PLE defaults to
SSD residency, so a smaller host degrades to SSD-bound expert access rather
than refusing to start. If the user has less than 128 GiB, warn them that the
configuration is untested and performance will likely drop, but do not treat
it as a hard blocker.

## Setup sequence

Follow [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) exactly. Summary of the
happy path:

```bash
# 1. Clone with submodules (required — vendor forks and kernels live there)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Dyluhn/R9V.git
cd R9V

# 2. Sanity checks (no GPU or download needed)
./r9v validate qwen38
./r9v doctor qwen38

# 3. Download the model package (90.36 GiB, pinned HF revision).
#    Confirm license acceptance with the user first.
export MODEL_DIR=/path/with/100GiB/free/qwen38-r9v
./r9v fetch qwen38 --model-dir "$MODEL_DIR" --accept-model-license
./r9v verify qwen38 --model-dir "$MODEL_DIR" -- --hash

# 4. Build the runtime image. This source-builds PyTorch, Triton, AITER, the
#    vLLM fork, and the R9V kernels. Expect hours of CPU time and tens of GiB
#    of Docker build storage on the first run. Later runs reuse layers.
R9V_MAX_JOBS=8 ./r9v build qwen38

# 5. Derive the PLE payload (26.82 GiB, goes on a fast SSD).
#    Exact docker command: docs/installation.md step 4.
#    Verify: the output file must be exactly 28800138240 bytes.

# 6. Launch
export R9V_DATA_DIR=/fast-ssd/r9v
export R9V_PLE_PATH="$R9V_DATA_DIR/per_layer_token_embd.iq4_nl.bin"
export R9V_CACHE_DIR="$R9V_DATA_DIR/cache"
export R9V_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1        # confirm order with `amd-smi list` first
./r9v doctor qwen38 --model-dir "$MODEL_DIR"
./r9v run qwen38 --model-dir "$MODEL_DIR"
```

Long operations (fetch, build, PLE derivation) should be run in a way that
survives your session — suggest `tmux`/`screen` or run them detached and poll.

## Verifying it works

Startup takes several minutes. Poll rather than assuming readiness — up to
~15 minutes before concluding failure:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8004/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8004/v1/models
```

Then issue a real completion. The served model name defaults to
`qwen3.8-flash-next` (confirm against `/v1/models`):

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8004/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "qwen3.8-flash-next", "max_tokens": 32,
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello."}]}'
```

If the health check never passes, read the container logs:
`docker logs --tail 200 r9v-qwen38-flash-next`.

## Environment variables

Set by the user or you; the launcher validates them. Caller values override
profile defaults.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `R9V_MODEL_DIR` | required | Root of the verified model package |
| `R9V_PLE_PATH` | required | Path to the derived PLE payload |
| `R9V_CACHE_DIR` | `.cache` in repo | Runtime cache directory |
| `R9V_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | `0,1` | ROCm device order; rank order is semantic |
| `R9V_HOST_PORT` | `8004` | Host port for the OpenAI endpoint |
| `R9V_CONTAINER_NAME` | `r9v-qwen38-flash-next` | Container name |
| `R9V_MAX_JOBS` | — | Parallel build jobs for `build` |

## Common failure modes

- **`doctor` fails on GPU checks** — the host is not the reference topology.
  This profile only supports two `gfx1201` R9700s. Report it; do not force.
- **`fetch` fails** — check that the `hf` CLI is installed and the disk has
  space. The download targets a pinned revision, so a moved branch is never
  the cause.
- **`build` fails partway** — usually disk exhaustion or Docker/Buildx
  missing. Re-running reuses completed layers.
- **`run` refuses to start** — an existing container with the profile name is
  present. Stop and remove it deliberately:
  `docker stop r9v-qwen38-flash-next && docker rm r9v-qwen38-flash-next`.
- **PLE size mismatch** — re-derive; do not launch with a wrong-size file.
- **Server up but slow** — confirm device order with `amd-smi list` and that
  the PLE file is on a fast SSD.
