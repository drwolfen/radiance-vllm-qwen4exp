## v0.4.4 (2026-09-24)

### `qwen38-mtp4-uncensored`: `--ced on` shares VRAM with the vision encoder

- The default `--ced on` now keeps the vision encoder's weights (0.42 GiB per
  GPU) and its bf16 projector (1.76 GiB per GPU) in one VRAM region per GPU,
  the way `--ced quality` does since v0.4.3. No step uses both: image and
  video prompts never use CED. Both stay in pinned host RAM and the region is
  refilled when the other one is needed: the projector before an approximate
  prefill chunk (35–39 ms on GPU 0, 262 ms on GPU 1), the vision encoder
  before an image is encoded (8–9 ms / 63 ms). A swap happens only when a CED
  prompt follows an image or the other way round.
- Where `on`'s VRAM went: its approximate chunk peaks in the eager head
  (layers 0–15, 0.84 GiB above the step's start, against 0.62 GiB for a
  compiled exact chunk), not in the projector math. The bf16 maps are applied
  in place with no temporaries, so unlike `quality` there were no
  dequantization buffers to shrink. The saving is the vision encoder's
  0.42 GiB.
- Clean-install GPU test on the reference host (fresh clone, setup and first
  start with `--ced on`, desktop apps holding about 1.2 GiB of GPU 0). Minimum
  free VRAM during first-start qualification, which includes the
  130,941-token prompt at the 131,072 context limit:

  | GPU 0 / GPU 1 | v0.4.4 | v0.4.3 |
  |---|---|---|
  | `on` (default) | **2.07 / 2.52 GiB** | 1.65 / 2.12 GiB |
  | `quality` | 2.04 / 2.49 GiB | 2.04 / 2.49 GiB |
  | `off` | 3.67 / 4.15 GiB | 3.68 / 4.15 GiB |

  The target is 1.5 GiB. In a separate session v0.4.3's `on` file gave
  1.65 / 2.12 and v0.4.4's 2.06–2.16 / 2.52–2.61.
- Unchanged: prefill speedup 1.59× at 12,836 tokens and 1.77× at 32,356
  (v0.4.3: 1.58× / 1.76×); warm decode median 39.1–39.2 ms/step against
  40.9 for v0.4.3's `on` file in the same session; exact requests after a CED
  request bitwise identical to fresh exact runs, `r9v_ced: false` and
  repeated greedy runs identical, nothing compiled after the first CED
  request. 24 alternating long-CED and image requests (a new image each time)
  kept VRAM flat (GPU 0 free 2,116 MiB throughout) and read every image; a
  long CED request with 3 image requests sent during it completed.
- Outputs: CED's numerics are unchanged. In a development build on the GPU
  every projector map read back from the region equalled the file after
  each swap, and every map's product was bitwise the product from a
  separately allocated copy (v0.4.3's layout), in the same server. The vision
  encoder's output was bitwise identical to v0.4.3's for 9 images, before and
  after swaps.
- RAM: start needs 60.8 GiB available with `--ced on` instead of 56.3 GiB,
  the same as `quality`: every TP rank keeps pinned copies of the projector
  and of its share of the vision encoder (4.50 GiB in 64 MiB slabs;
  measured +4.5 GiB of shared memory). The doctor adds them to the start
  check for `on` as well and names the mode. `--ced off` still needs
  56.3 GiB and its launch configuration is byte-identical to v0.4.3's.
- Upgrading: the runtime descriptor changed, so an existing install qualifies
  again once on its next start, in any CED mode. An unchanged restart after
  that reuses the receipt (219 s in the test).

## v0.4.3 (2026-09-24)

### `qwen38-mtp4-uncensored`: `--ced quality` now fits next to the vision encoder

- `--ced quality` now passes first-start qualification on the reference host,
  with image support kept. In v0.4.2 it failed there: GPU 0 fell to 0.90 GiB
  free against the 1.5 GiB target.
- Measured on the compiled server, two things made the difference:
  - The vision encoder's weights (0.42 GiB per GPU) and the quality projector
    (1.79 GiB per GPU) were both in VRAM all the time, although no step ever
    uses both: image and video prompts never use CED. They now take turns in
    one VRAM region per GPU, sized for the projector. Both stay in pinned host
    RAM, and the region is refilled when the other one is needed: the
    projector before an approximate prefill chunk, the vision encoder before
    an image is encoded. A swap takes 36 ms (projector) and 9 ms (vision) on
    GPU 0 (PCIe Gen5 x16), and 266 ms and 63 ms on GPU 1 (Gen4 x4); it happens
    only when a CED prompt follows an image or the other way round.
  - Each approximate chunk made two 400 MiB bf16 copies of the projector's
    int8 "final" map. The maps are now dequantized at most 2,560 rows at a
    time, in place. The KV and GDN state CED writes is bitwise unchanged;
    the "final" output, which only the MTP drafter reads, differs in rounding.

  The region alone brought GPU 0 from 0.84 to 1.25 GiB free; the smaller
  dequantization buffers did the rest.
- Clean-install GPU test on the reference host (fresh clone, setup and first
  start with `--ced quality`, desktop apps holding 1.23 GiB of GPU 0):

  | | v0.4.3 `quality` | v0.4.2 `quality` | v0.4.3 `on` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Min free VRAM in qualification, GPU 0 / GPU 1 | **2.04 / 2.49 GiB** (passes) | 0.90 / 1.77 GiB (failed) | 1.65 / 2.12 GiB |
  | Prefill speedup, ~12.8K tokens | 1.47× | 1.49× | 1.58× |
  | Prefill speedup, ~32K tokens | 1.62× | 1.64× | 1.76× |
  | Warm decode (ms/step) | 35.8–41.6 | 38.4–39.1 | 36.0–43.2 |
  | MTP tokens/step, answer after a CED prefill vs exact | −6% | −6% | |

  Decode is the same path in every mode; the spread is host noise. 24
  alternating long-CED and image requests (a new image each time) swapped 24
  times with VRAM flat (GPU 0 free 2,088 MiB throughout) and read every
  image's text correctly. A long CED request with 3 image requests sent
  during it: all completed (the images waited for the prefill, about 11 s).
  The vision encoder's output was bitwise identical to `--ced on`'s (no
  shared region) for 8 test images, before and after swaps (checked with a
  development build that logs a hash of it); the text answers to the same
  image vary slightly between server starts in every mode, as exact outputs
  already did. Exact requests after a CED request were bitwise identical to
  fresh exact runs, repeated greedy runs were identical, and nothing compiled
  after the first CED request. `on` and `off` qualified in the same session
  and an unchanged restart reused its receipt (ready in 177 s).
- Start needs 4.50 GiB more available RAM with `--ced quality` (60.8 GiB
  instead of 56.3): every TP rank keeps pinned host copies of the projector
  and of its share of the vision encoder, in 64 MiB slabs. The doctor adds
  them to the start check and says so. Measured: 4.2 GiB less available RAM
  at peak than `on`.
- `on` and `off` are unchanged: the shared region is only in the CED quality
  model file, which is mounted only with `--ced quality`.
- Upgrading: the runtime descriptor changed, so an existing install qualifies
  again once on its next start, in any CED mode.

## v0.4.2 (2026-09-24)

### `qwen38-mtp4-uncensored`: CED quality mode (opt-in)

- `--ced quality` in setup or start runs a multi-source CED projector: the
  layer-16 state plus the inputs of full-attention layers 3, 7, 11 and 15.
  `on` stays the default; `off` and `on` launch exactly as in v0.4.1.
- The tradeoff, from one GPU grade of both projectors (both loaded as int8,
  eager grading server) on the 16 prompts that depend on their long context:

  | `--ced` | Perplexity | Long-context gain lost | Prefill speedup (median) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `on` | ×1.049 | 17% | 1.68× |
  | `quality` | ×1.029 | 10% | 1.55× |

  The projector math costs 56 ms per 1K approximated tokens instead of 24 ms.
- The quality projector ships stored as int8: 1.79 GiB per GPU, about what the
  default bf16 projector takes. In bf16 it would need 3.5 GiB per GPU and did
  not fit on GPU 1 in the grade. The int8 file loads bit-identically to what
  the grade ran.
- It is an optional file in the model package (1.8 GB). Setup downloads it
  only with `--ced quality`; `start --ced quality` before that is refused and
  says to run setup with it. The doctor checks it against its pinned SHA-256
  and counts it in the VRAM budget.
- **Not recommended (tested after release on the compiled server).** In the
  clean-install GPU test (fresh clone of v0.4.2, setup and first start with
  `--ced quality`), the server loaded the projector with its five sources and
  ran all seven qualification checks, including the 130,941-token prompt, but
  its peak VRAM is about 0.75 GiB higher on GPU 0 and 0.35 GiB higher on GPU 1
  than `on`. With desktop apps holding 1.24 GiB of GPU 0, the minimum free
  VRAM was 0.90 GiB on GPU 0 and 1.77 GiB on GPU 1 (target 1.5 GiB), so
  qualification failed and `start` exited with an error. `on` passed in the
  same session with 1.65 / 2.12 GiB free. Quality can pass only when other
  programs use less than about 0.6 GiB of GPU 0.
- Measured on the compiled server, same session:

  | | `quality` | `on` |
  |---|---|---|
  | Prefill speedup, 12,900 tokens | 1.49× | 1.54× |
  | Prefill speedup, 32,253 tokens | 1.64× | 1.74× |
  | Warm decode (ms/step, 3 runs) | 38.4–39.1 | 39.0–41.6 |
  | MTP tokens/step, answer after a CED prefill vs exact | −6% | −7% |

  Decode is the same path in both (short prompts do not use CED); the spread
  is host noise. In both modes an exact request after a CED request was
  bitwise identical to a fresh exact run, repeated greedy runs were identical,
  and nothing recompiled after the first CED request. `on` stays the default
  and is unchanged from v0.4.1.
- The model package moves to revision `8112610745a8ddc3a19cc659314af245820ee728`,
  which adds the quality projector; the 24 files published before are
  unchanged, so an existing install downloads nothing new unless it picks
  `--ced quality`.

### `./r9v doctor --runtime`

- Right after a first start, `runtime-kv-pressure` no longer fails because of
  qualification's own 130,941-token prompt, which is preempted about 7 times
  before it completes. Start records that count with the qualification
  receipt, and the doctor discounts it for the same container only. Any
  rewind after qualification still fails.

### Upgrading from v0.4.1

- The runtime descriptor changed (it pins the new model file), so an existing
  install qualifies again once on its next start, whatever its CED mode.

### Testing

- CPU tests, static checks and the launch parity tests (`on` and `off` launch
  exactly as the GPU-tested v0.4.1 container) pass. The clean-install GPU test
  was not rerun for v0.4.2.

## v0.4.1 (2026-09-24)

### `qwen38-mtp4-uncensored`: smaller host expert copy

- Rank 1 now keeps its 400 most-used experts per layer in VRAM for good, so
  its host (RAM) copy of the experts holds only the other 112. The host copy
  drops from 55.4 GiB to 40.3 GiB.
- Start now needs **56.3 GiB** of available RAM (`R9V_MIN_HOST_AVAILABLE_BYTES`
  = 60,424,720,384) instead of 71.4 GiB: the host copy plus the 16 GiB PLE
  reserve. In the GPU test the most available RAM fell was 49 GiB (41 GiB
  shared host copy plus the workers), about 7 GiB under the floor.
- GPU test on the reference host against the 1.3.0 runtime, back to back:
  bit-identical prompt logprobs on 5 prompts (3K–15K tokens) and identical
  greedy probes on 2; decode 34.87 vs 34.83 ms/step on short prompts; a
  127,238-token prompt ran; peak shared host memory 41 GiB instead of 56 GiB.
- The pin list ships with the runtime, SHA-256 pinned twice (runtime descriptor
  and runtime). `tools/pin_sim/` regenerates it from the routing trace it
  records.
- Nothing on the host has to change: the host copy is not locked in memory,
  and the profile runs on stock rootless Docker.

### `./r9v doctor`

New checks, each with a fix that needs no root or host changes:

- `disk-space`: what fetch and setup still have to write, per filesystem.
- `vram-other-processes`: which programs hold VRAM on the R9V GPUs.
- `api-exposure`: warns when `R9V_HOST_BIND` publishes the unauthenticated API
  beyond this machine.
- `runtime-overlays`: every file mounted over the image matches its SHA-256.
- `ced-projector`: the CED projector is the package's pinned file, for the
  profile's split; its VRAM counts in the budget check.
- `expert-limit-consistency`: the full mutable cache's expert ceilings, cache
  slots and pin list match its fixed placement.

### Other

- `start` waits 2,400 s by default for a full mutable expert cache
  (`qwen38-mtp4-uncensored`).
- `./r9v soak PROFILE -- --decode-speed FILE` measures decode ms/step right
  after start and once warm and saves both as JSON, so a clean-install test
  keeps its warm decode numbers.
- `tools/image_bundle.py --verify-only` downloads and verifies an image
  bundle without loading it.

- `./r9v COMMAND PROFILE --state-dir DIR -- ARGS` no longer passes the `--` on to
  the tool; before, `soak ... -- --decode-speed FILE` and
  `doctor ... -- --runtime` failed with "unrecognized arguments".

### Upgrading from v0.4.0

- The runtime changed, so an existing install qualifies again once on its
  first start (a few minutes); later restarts reuse the new receipt.

### Clean-install GPU test (reference host, 2026-09-24)

Fresh clone, fetch, verify, setup, first start with CED on and off, and an
unchanged restart all passed:

- First start (cold compile, CED on): ready in 387 s; qualification passed
  all 7 checks, including a 130,941-token prompt. Peak shared host memory
  41.7 GiB.
- Warm decode 36.8 ms/step on the soak prompt mix (prose about 35.8).
- CED prefill speedup 1.52x at 12,970 tokens and 1.82x at 32,145 tokens. An
  exact request after a CED request was bitwise identical to a fresh exact run.
- Unchanged restart reused the receipt and was ready in 177 s; the
  running-server doctor had 0 FAIL.

### Known issue

- Right after a first start, `./r9v doctor --runtime` can report
  `runtime-kv-pressure` FAIL: qualification's own 130,941-token prompt is
  preempted a few times (it still completes and passes). The counter resets on
  restart, and the doctor is then clean. Planned for v0.4.2.

### Local deployment verification (radiance host, 2026-09-26)

Replaced the running `r9v-qwen38-flash-next` service (previously the standard
`qwen38` ud-iq4-xs profile on the v0.3.0-era image) with
`qwen38-mtp4-uncensored` on the v0.4.4 runtime, installed from the published
artifacts:

- Model package `qwen38-flash-next-uncensored-iq4-xs-mtp-blockfp8-mmproj-f16`
  fetched from HF `Dyluhn/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Uncensored-R9V-IQ4_XS@8112610`:
  20 required artifacts, 92.39 GiB, size+sha256 verified (1 optional absent).
- Runtime image `sha256:2dac17a2...` loaded from the `v0.3.0-rc1-images`
  public bundle; all 16 runtime overlays match their pinned SHA-256.
- Setup: host doctor PASS=27 WARN=4 FAIL=0; PLE table 26.82 GiB derived.
- First start (cold compile, CED on): ready in ~600 s; first-start
  qualification passed (including the 130,941-token prompt); runtime doctor
  PASS=33 WARN=6 FAIL=0.
- CED prefill, same server, 14,420-token prompt, `max_tokens=1`: 6.25 s with
  `--ced on` vs 10.86 s with `"vllm_xargs": {"r9v_ced": false}` = **1.74x**.
- MTP: 54 drafts / 109 accepted, mean emitted length 3.019, acceptance 50.5%.
- Rollback retained: the previous image (`r9v-qwen38-flash-next:latest`,
  `sha256:36237d4034b0`) and its launching script were left in place.

### 192K context on the radiance host (2026-09-26)

The model is natively 256K (`qwen4exp.context_length=262144`, rope base 1e7, no
rope scaling), so the 128K cap was configuration. The
`qwen38-mtp4-uncensored` envelope was raised to 192K without attenuating decode:

- `R9V_MAX_MODEL_LEN=196608`, `R9V_KV_CACHE_MEMORY_BYTES=3672113152`; runtime
  descriptor `context_tokens=196608`.
- Qualification ceilings raised 131072 -> 262144 in
  `tools/qualify_runtime.py` (`workload_context`) and
  `tools/runtime_workload.py` (`--context`).
- GPU KV cache 137,196 -> 213,995 tokens; concurrency at the full envelope
  1.05x -> 1.09x. KV measured at 18,676 B/token per rank.
- Re-qualified at the new envelope: passed, `context_limit=196608`, headroom
  passed (min free 2.06 / 1.52 GiB against the 1.5 GiB target). The
  196,479-token probe was preempted 4 times by the fixed KV budget and still
  completed, matching the documented first-start behaviour.
- Decode unchanged: 21.60 -> 21.66 ms/step (median, fixed prompt, MTP4);
  mean acceptance length 2.93. CED prefill 1.57-1.74x at 14,420 tokens.

### Concurrency test: `max_num_seqs` stays 1 (2026-09-26)

Raising `max_num_seqs` to 4 (with cudagraph capture sizes `[1,5,10,15,20]`)
was tested and rejected on the radiance host:

- Throughput fell: 1 stream 41.7 tok/s, 2 streams 22.7, 4 streams 29.9, while
  TPOT rose to 245-360 ms. MTP speculation stayed healthy (48-73% acceptance),
  so the cost is concurrent decode against the shared arbitrary-expert cache
  and the fixed KV budget, not speculation.
- Qualification refused it: `workload-envelope` ("concurrency or MTP depth
  differs from the one-sequence/MTP4 reference") and headroom (peak free on
  rank 1 1.425 GiB < the 1.5 GiB target; the one-sequence run kept 1.518).
- Extended-suite and soak results for the retained one-sequence profile
  (2026-09-26): 41.5 tok/s single-stream, TPOT p50 55.5 ms, APC 1.03x, tool
  PASS; prefill 1,265-6,198 tok/s from 8K to 143K with CED; needle retrieval
  at 130,919 tokens, vision and greedy determinism passed; 600 s soak passed
  with 60 requests and 0 errors.

The single active sequence remains the qualified configuration.
