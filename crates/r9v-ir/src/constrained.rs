//! Typed constrained-device (spoof) foundation for planning
//! (Spec 1 App. A, Spec 5 §2, Spec 14 §3).
//!
//! A physical [`DeviceDescriptor`] always stays truthful: discovery populates
//! it, nothing here mutates it, and the stable [`DeviceIdentity`] travels
//! unchanged into every view. Planning against a smaller card than the bench
//! hardware uses an *effective* view instead: [`ConstrainedDevice`] derives an
//! [`EffectiveDeviceView`] whose VRAM and CU counts are reduced to a catalog
//! profile, and [`Provenance`] records whether a plan ran against physical
//! facts or a spoof target.
//!
//! The effective view is deliberately **not** a [`DeviceDescriptor`]: it
//! carries no `measured` performance block and no `p2p` links, so physical
//! measured performance can never travel as a spoof fact, and there is no
//! conversion back into a bare descriptor that could drop provenance. Every
//! planning number the view exposes is reachable only beside
//! [`Provenance::Spoof`], and any attempt to use a spoof result for official
//! qualification or a performance claim fails with the typed
//! [`IrError::SpoofQualificationRefused`](crate::IrError::SpoofQualificationRefused)
//! refusal via [`Provenance::check_official_claim`].
//!
//! The pre-queue [`PreQueueLaunchContract`] turns the reduced CU count into a
//! deterministic `ROC_GLOBAL_CU_MASK` assignment that the launcher applies,
//! and validates a caller-supplied value before HIP queue creation; library
//! code never writes the process environment.
//!
//! Cross-crate contract (spec 14 §3): this crate supplies the effective VRAM
//! bound and pre-queue validation. The top-level load path creates one
//! `r9v_hip::AllocationBudget` per constrained device from that bound and uses
//! `r9v_hip::BudgetedDeviceBuffer` exclusively; the launcher applies the CU
//! assignment before the engine process starts, and the engine validates it
//! before HIP initialization. The mask narrows CU visibility, while the
//! allocation ledger independently enforces the VRAM cap.
//!
//! Initial catalog (data, not branches): the only profiles are the two
//! gfx1201 spoof targets. Execution dispatches on [`SpoofProfileId`], never
//! on product-name strings.
