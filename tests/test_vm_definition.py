"""Static guards for the hardware-blind R9V development VM definition.

The VM must stay hardware-blind by construction: a generic named CPU (never
the host model), fixed topology, KVM only with a TCG fallback, no host path
or sysfs shares, no GPU nodes, sources synced to guest disk over SSH, and
results explicitly marked non-authoritative. Only vm/r9v-hw-container.sh may
name host devices. These tests read the checked-in files; they download,
install, boot, and start nothing.
