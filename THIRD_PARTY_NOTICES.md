# Third-party notices

These notices describe the exact pinned source graph in
`release/sources.lock.json`.

## R9V gfx1201 kernels

The R9V-owned kernel repository is licensed under Apache License 2.0 and
retains the llama.cpp/ggml MIT attribution for the GGUF quant primitives it
consumes from the plugin.

Project: https://github.com/Dyluhn/r9v-gfx1201-kernels

## vLLM

R9V integrates and modifies [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The distributed vLLM fork retains the upstream license and marks modified files.

## vLLM GGUF plugin

R9V integrates and modifies the [vLLM GGUF plugin](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-gguf-plugin), licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The distributed plugin fork retains the upstream license and marks modified files.

## llama.cpp / ggml

The GGUF quantization implementation contains source copied or adapted from llama.cpp/ggml. Current source annotations identify historical llama.cpp revision `b2899`, including material from `mmq.cu`, `mmvq.cu`, `convert.cu`, `vecdotq.cuh`, and `ggml-common.h`.

## Qwen model artifacts

The target GGUF, vision projector, MTP checkpoint, tokenizer, processor metadata, and extracted PLE representation are model artifacts derived from Qwen3.8 Flash Next. They are not covered by R9V's Apache-2.0 code license.

Project: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next

License: [Qwen Community License 1.0](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next/raw/main/LICENSE)

## Unsloth IQ4_XS target

The target shards use Unsloth's `UD-IQ4_XS` quantization of Qwen3.8 Flash Next.

Project: https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF

The exact source revision and file hashes are pinned in `release/sources.lock.json`. The model remains under Qwen Community License 1.0; Unsloth is credited for the quantized artifact.

## ggml-org vision projector

The current Q8_0 vision projector is distributed by ggml-org and was produced with llama.cpp conversion tooling; it was not independently quantized by R9V.

Project: https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF

The exact source revision and projector hash are pinned in `release/sources.lock.json`.

## Radiance development lineage

The inspected `StillDeadcode/vllm-radiance` upstream tree does not contain an
explicit license. The dual-card profile evolved from that deployment and
profiling workflow, but the legacy launcher and R4D kernels are not
distributed. A previously copied multimodal speculative-layout snippet has
been replaced by an R9V implementation specified and tested from the runtime
invariant: the multimodal marker mask must select the same compacted rows as
the draft-token buffer. Compatibility environment-variable names do not
import or relicense Radiance source.

That replacement and its tests are pinned in the audited vLLM revision. The
public tag remains gated on repeating the file-level provenance review against
the final frozen release revisions.

## Muse Glimmer / R9V V1

Muse Glimmer model artifacts are published by Meta under Apache-2.0. R9V V1
(internal V12 lineage) is a modified quantization derived immediately from
Unsloth's pinned Q8_0 GGUF. Meta, Unsloth, and llama.cpp/ggml are attributed
in `MODEL_LICENSES/Muse-Glimmer-30B.md` and the package source lock.
