# Spec 5 — Sharding and Partitioner

Status: draft 0.1 (2026-09-02). Owner: Dylan. Depends on: specs 1–4. Constrains: specs 6, 9, 11, 12.

## 0. Purpose and scope

How a single-device graph becomes a multi-device execution: the topology model, the parallel strategies, the partitioner that rewrites the graph using each op's sharding table, the placement planner that picks a strategy at load time, and the comms transport under the collective ops. Also what "correct" means across device counts, and the config surface.

Out of scope: which sequences run in a step (spec 6), the row cache that backs tiered tensors (spec 9), kernel-level reductions (spec 4 §5.9).

## 1. Principles

1. **The partitioner only applies tables.** Every sharding decision is a lookup in an op's spec 1 table plus a collective inserted where layouts mismatch. It contains no model knowledge.
2. **Placement is decided at load, not per step.** Changing TP degree or PP boundaries moves weights; weights don't move at runtime. The planner chooses one placement for the configured workload profile, and per-step variation is limited to things that don't move bytes.
3. **Latency profile favors one hop per token.** On 2–4 consumer cards over PCIe, pipeline parallel costs one transfer per token per step; tensor parallel costs two collectives per layer. The default plan for `profile = latency` is PP unless VRAM or an explicit config says otherwise.
4. **Host experts are computed on the host.** At low batch, moving an expert's weights to the GPU costs 100× more than moving the hidden state to the CPU. A `tiered` placement hint on experts resolves to CPU compute for the cold set (`Host`, spec 2 §5); fetching weights to device (`Tiered`, host_fetch) is a throughput-mode option only.
5. **P2P is measured, never assumed.** Every link is `Direct` or `HostStaged` per the doctor's measurement; the collective ops are identical either way.
6. **Replicated tensors are bit-identical across ranks.** Every reduction is computed in the same fixed order on every rank. Divergence between ranks is a bug class this spec is designed to make impossible.
7. **Device count is data.** Zero, one and N GPUs are ordinary discovery results. CPU is always present; no engine path may require a second GPU, and no peer operation exists when fewer than two GPUs are selected.

## 2. Topology

```
Topology {
  devices: [ { rank, descriptor: DeviceDescriptor, vram_free: u64,
               pcie_path: [ { bdf, current: { speed_gts, width }, maximum: { speed_gts, width } } ],
               pcie_capacity_bottleneck } ]
  links:   [ (a, b, transport: Direct | HostStaged, gbps: f32, latency_us: f32) ]   # measured, directed
  host:    { cores, simd: Baseline | AVX2 | AVX512 | AVX512_VNNI | AMX, mem_gbps: f32, pinned_budget: u64 }
}
```

Populated by the doctor's measurement pass (spec 11) and cached by hardware fingerprint. PCIe discovery walks from each endpoint through every upstream PCI bridge to the root and records both current and maximum speed/width for every hop. Configured capacity uses maximum speed with negotiated width: current speed is diagnostic because power management may downshift an idle link, while current width detects lane allocation, bifurcation and degraded training. The capacity bottleneck is the hop with the lowest configured payload capacity; endpoint link files alone are not a topology measurement. If the endpoint or any link-bearing ancestor lacks a complete positive speed/width capacity pair, GPU discovery fails with a typed diagnostic rather than omitting that hop. H2D, D2H and peer-copy measurements—not PCIe labels—supply planner bandwidth.

The reference rig is one gfx1201 path at Gen5 x16 and one path capped by an upstream Gen4 x4 root port even though that GPU endpoint reports Gen5 x16. Direct P2P capability is independent of this width and remains selected only when the measured direct path wins. For N selected GPUs, the doctor measures every directed pair `a != b`; zero or one GPU produces an empty link list.

The cardinality rules are mechanical:

- zero GPUs: CPU plan; GPU measurements and peer checks are skipped;
- one GPU: single-device plan; link list and collectives are empty;
- N GPUs: ranks are assigned after stable UUID+BDF discovery, and strategies are evaluated from the measured topology without a two-device special assumption.

## 3. Strategies

| strategy | what is sharded | comms per layer per step | when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | nothing | none | no GPU selected or explicit CPU execution |
| **Single** | nothing | none | one GPU, or the model and requested profile fit one selected GPU |
| **PP** | layers by range | one `send/recv` of `[T, Dm]` at each stage boundary (per step, not per layer) | default for `latency`; any model that doesn't fit one device |
| **TP** | attention heads; MLP columns/rows | 2 × `all_reduce` of `[T, Dm]` | `throughput`, or a single layer too large for one device |
| **EP** | experts by device | `all_to_all` dispatch + combine of routed tokens | `throughput` on MoE; never at `latency` |
| **PP + TP** | PP stages, TP inside a stage | both | 4+ devices, large dense models |
| **Host experts** | cold experts on CPU | hidden state `[T_routed, Dm]` D2H and H2D per MoE layer | MoE that doesn't fit VRAM, any profile |
| **Replicas** | nothing; independent engines | none | small models, `throughput`; handled by spec 10, not here |

### 3.1 PP

- Stage boundaries chosen to balance **estimated step time**, not layer count: per-layer decode cost is proportional to weight bytes resident on device (bandwidth-bound) plus, for MoE, the host-compute share. Embedding and `lm_head` are charged to their stages.
- Each stage owns state pools only for its layers (spec 3 §7).
- Micro-batching (`pp_microbatches ∈ {1, 2}`) splits a batch so both stages work concurrently; `latency` uses 1, `throughput` uses 2 when `S ≥ 2`.
- Sampling runs on the last stage; the sampled tokens are sent back to stage 0 as part of the next step's `token_ids` (one small transfer).

### 3.2 TP

Canonical per-layer pattern, from the spec 1 tables:

```
qkv:   x Replicated × w ColShard(heads)   → q,k,v HeadShard
attn:  HeadShard → HeadShard                (state head-sharded, spec 3 §7)
o:     HeadShard × w RowShard              → Partial
residual + all_reduce                       → Replicated        (§4.2 residual trick)
norm:  Replicated
gate/up: Replicated × ColShard             → ColShard
act_mul: ColShard
down:  ColShard × RowShard                 → Partial
residual + all_reduce                       → Replicated
```

Two `all_reduce` per layer. `hkv % ranks == 0` is required; models where it isn't can replicate KV heads (`hkv_local = hkv`) at a small VRAM cost, which the partitioner does automatically and logs. `lm_head` is `ColShard(V)` followed by `all_gather` of logits (spec 1 §4.F).

### 3.3 EP

- Expert placement map `expert → rank`. Routing runs replicated; the `all_to_all` dispatch carries each token's hidden state to the ranks holding its `K` experts; `moe_ffn` runs on local experts; a second `all_to_all` returns partial outputs, combined in f32 in expert-index order.
- Buffers are fixed-size per bucket at worst case (`T · K` rows per peer); valid counts travel in a small header exchanged inside the collective, so the captured graph never changes shape.
- Shared experts, if any, run replicated as a plain `matmul`.

### 3.4 Host experts

- The `tiered` placement hint on expert tensors (spec 2 §4) resolves at load into a **hot set** (`Device`, chosen by calibration frequency from the quant tool or by a warm-up pass) and a **cold set** (`Host`: `L1` layout in pinned memory, computed by T0v; or `Tiered`: slab-backed, fetched to device in `host_fetch` mode). The hot set is fixed for the model's lifetime (spec 9 §5.4).
- Per MoE layer, the graph is captured as a segment boundary: router runs on device → expert ids and the routed hidden rows for cold experts are copied D2H → the CPU tier (spec 4 §2, T0v) computes those experts' outputs → results H2D → combine. Hot experts run on device concurrently. The scheduler (spec 6) owns the segment sequencing; this spec only fixes that the segment exists.
- Cost per layer at batch 1: ≈ 2 transfers of `Dm × 2 B` (≈ 16 KB) plus CPU GEMV over `K_cold` experts. With AVX-512 VNNI, a 4096 × 1536 int4 expert is ~1 ms on 8 cores; the design assumes ≤ 2 cold experts per token per layer on average for the latency profile to hold. The planner reports the expected cold rate from calibration data before load.
- `HostFetch` (pull cold expert weights to device instead of computing on host) is available for `throughput` when `T ≥ 64`, where the fetch amortizes across tokens. It uses the spec 9 row cache with `residency_unit = expert`.

## 4. Partitioner

### 4.1 Algorithm

Input: the single-device graph, a `Plan` (§5), and the spec 1 sharding tables.

1. **Assign weights.** Every weight tensor gets a `ShardLayout` and a rank set from the plan (PP: rank by layer; TP: `ColShard`/`RowShard`/`HeadShard` by role; EP: `ExpertShard`).
2. **Propagate.** Walk the graph in topological order; for each op pick the table row whose input layouts match; if none matches, insert the cheapest collective that makes one match (`all_reduce` for `Partial → Replicated`, `all_gather` for `ColShard → Replicated`, `reduce_scatter` for `Partial → RowShard`).
3. **Cut.** At PP boundaries insert `send`/`recv` of every live tensor crossing the cut (normally just the residual stream) and split the graph into per-rank subgraphs.
4. **Coalesce.** Apply §4.2 and merge adjacent collectives on the same tensor.
5. **Emit** one graph per rank per bucket, with the collectives' peer sets and transports filled in from the topology.

The partitioner is a pure function of `(graph, plan, topology)` and its output is diffable; the doctor bundle stores the emitted per-rank graph summaries.

### 4.2 Residual trick

`residual_add(Partial, Replicated)` is rewritten so the residual is added on rank 0 only (other ranks add zero), producing a `Partial` whose single `all_reduce` yields the correct replicated sum. This folds the residual into the existing reduce and removes a separate replicate step. It is numerically identical to reduce-then-add because addition order inside the reduce is fixed.

### 4.3 What the partitioner refuses

- A model whose sharding tables can't be satisfied with the plan's device count (e.g. `hkv = 1` under TP without replication allowed).
- A plan that doesn't fit: weights + state pools + workspace per rank exceed `vram_free`. The error lists the per-rank shortfall.

## 5. Planner

### 5.1 Inputs and output

```
plan(model: ModelSummary, topology, config) -> Plan
Plan {
  strategy:        CPU | Single | PP | TP | EP | PP+TP
  stages:          [ { rank_set, layer_range } ]
  tp_degree:       u32
  expert_map:      { expert → (rank, Device | HostCompute | HostFetch) }
  transport:       { link → Direct | HostStaged }
  pp_microbatches: u32
  expected:        { step_us_by_bucket: {bucket → f32}, cold_expert_rate: f32 }
}
```

`ModelSummary` comes from the model definition (spec 8): per-layer weight bytes per scheme, state cost per token, expert count and sizes, `hkv`, `V`, `Dm`.

Topology devices always carry truthful discovered `DeviceDescriptor`s. When planning against a smaller card, the planner consumes the `EffectiveDeviceView` bounds (spec 1 App. A) in place of that device's CU/VRAM quantities — never a mutated descriptor — and the resulting `Plan` records the `Spoof` provenance with its qualified `MODEL (SPOOF)` target. Bandwidth and transport still come only from measured physical topology; the view carries no measured or P2P facts to substitute.

### 5.2 Selection

1. Select `CPU` for zero GPUs and `Single` for one GPU. For two or more GPUs, enumerate candidate plans for the discovered device set: `Single` where feasible; PP with each balanced boundary set; TP at each degree dividing `hkv`; EP for MoE; PP+TP for 4+ devices; host-expert variants when experts exceed VRAM.
2. Drop infeasible plans (§4.3).
3. Score each with the cost model for the profile's target buckets: `latency` scores `T ∈ {1, 2, 4}` with weights `{0.6, 0.3, 0.1}`; `throughput` scores `T ∈ {32, 128, 512}` equally.
4. Pick the minimum. Ties go to fewer collectives.

Cost model per step for a bucket: Σ over ranks on the critical path of `weight_bytes / mem_bw` + `activation_flops / rate` + Σ collectives `(latency_us + bytes / gbps)` × (2 if `HostStaged`) + host expert compute. Coefficients come from the tune files and the topology measurements, so the model is calibrated per machine.

### 5.3 Overrides

Config may pin any field of the plan. A pinned plan that is infeasible fails at load with the shortfall; a feasible but slower pinned plan loads and the log states the estimated cost versus the auto choice.

### 5.4 Stability

The plan is computed once per `(model, topology fingerprint, config)` and cached. It never changes while a model is loaded. If a device disappears, the engine stops rather than replanning under load.

## 6. Comms transport

### 6.1 Interface (used only by collective ops)

```
send(buf, peer, stream)         recv(buf, peer, stream)
all_reduce(buf, group, stream)  all_gather(bufs, group, stream)
reduce_scatter(...)              all_to_all(bufs, counts_hdr, group, stream)
barrier(group)
```

All buffers are fixed-size per bucket and pre-registered (pinned for `HostStaged`, peer-mapped for `Direct`). No allocation on the step path.

### 6.2 Implementation

v1 is an in-process implementation over HIP streams and events for every selected GPU. The zero- and one-GPU cases construct no comms objects. The direct-exchange implementation is optimized for 2–4 devices; the fixed-order path remains correct for larger N. Not RCCL: it adds a large dependency with inconsistent behavior on consumer RDNA, and at the message sizes this engine moves (`[T, Dm]` at small `T` is tens of KB) a direct exchange beats ring algorithms. An RCCL backend can be added behind the same interface for larger nodes.

- `Direct`: `hipMemcpyPeerAsync` or peer-mapped loads, whichever the doctor measured faster for the size class.
- `HostStaged`: D2H into a pinned bounce buffer, H2D to the peer; two copies, both on the sender's stream, with an event the receiver waits on.
- `all_reduce` for `ranks ≤ 4`: every rank sends its buffer to every other rank; each rank adds all buffers in ascending rank order (spec 4 §5.9). Same bits on every rank. For `ranks > 4` a reduce-scatter/all-gather pair with the same fixed order.
- `all_to_all`: a 64-byte count header per peer travels first; payload copies are fixed-size; the receiver reads only `counts` rows.

### 6.3 Streams

Each rank has a compute stream and a comms stream. Collectives are enqueued on the comms stream with events on both sides. With `pp_microbatches = 2`, stage `i`'s send of micro-batch 0 overlaps its compute of micro-batch 1. At `latency` there is nothing to overlap and the collective sits on the critical path; the cost model charges it fully.

## 7. Correctness across device counts

- **CPU-only and single-GPU are first-class.** The full T0 graph runs with no HIP runtime or GPU. A one-GPU plan contains no collective nodes and must match T0 within the tier tolerance.
- **Cardinality matrix.** Hosted tests exercise discovered GPU counts 0, 1, 2 and 3; they assert plan kind, rank assignment, link count (`N × (N - 1)` directed links after measurement) and absence of peer calls for N < 2.
- **PP vs single device: bit-identical (L0).** No arithmetic changes; only where it runs.
- **TP or EP vs single device: within tolerance (L1).** Splitting K or experts across ranks changes reduction order. Run-to-run on the same plan is L0.
- **Across ranks under TP: bit-identical replicated tensors (L0).** Enforced by §6.2 ordering and tested by hashing every replicated tensor on every rank after each layer in debug mode.
- Batch invariance (spec 1 §6.1) holds under every plan because collectives operate on fixed-size buffers with masked padding and never reorder rows.

## 8. Config surface

```
[parallel]
profile        = "latency" | "throughput"           # default latency
devices        = "auto" | "cpu" | ["uuid-or-pci-bdf", ...]  # default auto
mode           = "auto" | "pp" | "tp" | "ep" | "pp+tp"
tp_degree      = auto | n
pp_stages      = auto | [[0..23], [24..47]]
pp_microbatches = auto | 1 | 2
[experts]
placement      = "auto" | "device" | "host_compute" | "host_fetch"
hot_set_vram   = auto | bytes
[comm]
transport      = "auto" | "p2p" | "host"
```

Numeric HIP ordinals may be accepted as an interactive process-local selector, but are resolved immediately to UUID+BDF and never written to a config, plan, cache key or receipt. Every `auto` resolves to a concrete stable identity in the plan file, which the doctor bundle includes, so a reported result always states exactly how the model was placed.
